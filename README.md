# 3600-proj Demonstrated the use of pipes and semaphores as a hand that catches and throws a ball

This project was written in the class Operating Systems. Code was given to the student by the instructor Gordon Griesel, whom tasked us with modifying the code to have a "hand" throw the ball and be caught by the opposing hand. Additional "balls" were introduced to simulate juggling.
